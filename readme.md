teaching-python

Welcome to the teaching-python repository!


## What this is

teaching-python is a very basic introduction to writing python code!

There are hundreds of courses and tutorials out there, many of which are great,
so this should not be your only resource! The actual goal of this is to get
you enough baseline information and intro knowledge that you can start learning
effectively on your own.

This is intended to be a bunch of self-directed information you can consume at
your own pace, with 'optional' paths you can opt-in to learning if you think it
applies to you or is something you're interested in.


## Help me help you and help each other in the process.

Ask questions, point out things that are missing, and help others by answering
questions or adding new information you learn on your own. When you find a cool
or helpful resource online, share it!


## Jupyter Notebooks

All the intro lessons in this repository will be using jupyter notebooks,
which is a fancy way to work on python (and other things!) in a visual,
interactive way. This is not the only way to use python, but while getting
started this is a simple, reliable, and quick way to get you working on code
and seeing your changes without having to deal with (many) mac vs windows
problems or differences across the dozens of different popular 'editors' out
there.


## Get Started

There are few things you have to install and setup before you can really get
started. This is often a little bit painful, especially if you are on windows
or haven't done this kind of thing before.

Set aside thirty minutes or so and do everything in the GETTING_STARTED.md
document. See you on the other side!
