# Getting Started

In an attempt to get you started as quickly as possible we are using a
technology called "docker" to run a little, pretend computer inside your actual
computer that is already all set up for this project. We'll go over how you can
actually run your own python code locally later on but for now, start here.


## Install docker

Install the stable, community edition of "docker desktop" by following the
instructions for your platform here: https://docs.docker.com/install/



## Copy this Project - Option 1 (harder but better) - git clone

There are many lessons worth of info about git and github but for now, install
git if you don't already have it on your computer (try `git --version` to
check) using the instructions here:

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

When you have that working, you can 'clone' this project to your local machine
so you can get started playing with python.

`git clone https://github.com/collingreen/teaching-python`


## Copy this Project - Option 2 (easier) - Download the repository manually

Download the following zip and unzip it into a folder.

https://github.com/collingreen/teaching-python/archive/master.zip


Either way, you now have this entire project copied to your local machine. Open
a terminal (might be 'command prompt' on windows) and move to this new folder
(maybe `cd c:/development/teaching-python` or `cd teaching-python`).


## Build and start the docker container

Call the `start` command (or `start.bat` if on windows) to build and run your
docker container.
